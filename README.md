# xshell
"xshell" or "xsh" is an Open Source Unix Shell built in C by forking a child process to execute the job, using GNU libreadline-dev, execvp system call for non built in commands and allows piping and background processes.

Quick Start:
$ chmod +x run
$ ./run

note: "run" is a bash script that compiles the program using gcc and a makefile, runs the binary and clears the screen for user experience
